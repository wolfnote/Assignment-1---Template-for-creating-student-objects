Functions
This repository demonstrates the implementation and comparison of JavaScript Classes and Constructor Functions with Prototypes. These concepts are foundational for understanding object-oriented programming (OOP) in JavaScript.

Project Structure
The repository contains two HTML files with embedded JavaScript:

Klase.html:

Demonstrates the usage of ES6+ class syntax to create a Student class.
Includes methods defined within the class (getInfo).
Example instances of students are created to showcase the class functionality.
Konstruktorske funkcije i prototipovi.html:

Implements the same Student structure using a traditional constructor function.
Methods are defined directly within the constructor function.
Example instances are created to demonstrate functionality.
Features
Student Object
The Student object includes:

Properties:
name: Name of the student.
address: Address of the student.
phone: Contact number of the student.
course: Course in which the student is enrolled.
Method:
getInfo(): Returns a formatted string containing all the student's details.
Output
Both implementations log the details of three sample students to the browser console.
How to Use
Clone this repository to your local machine:
bash
Copy code
git clone <repository-url>
Open the Klase.html or Konstruktorske funkcije i prototipovi.html files in a web browser.
Open the browser's console (F12 or Right-Click > Inspect > Console) to see the output.
Learning Objectives
Understand the differences between ES6+ class syntax and traditional constructor functions.
Explore object creation, method definition, and prototyping in JavaScript.
Technologies Used
HTML: For structuring the example files.
JavaScript: Core language demonstrating OOP techniques.
